                they changed the game entirely. Their styles, sounds, and creativity continue to inspire players around 
                the world. Let's take a look at some of the most influential guitarists of all time and the lasting impact

        <h2 id="GetSt">Getting Started</h2>
            <h3>First, here are some of the things you'll need to start playing, though some of these are optional</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Guitar</li>
                        <ul>This may seem obvious, but choosing the right guitar matters. Beginners usually start with either an acoustic
                            or a basic electric guitar. Go for something comfortable, reliable, and not too expensive. Just enough to get 
                            you going without stress.</ul>
                    <li>Tuner</li>
                        <ul>A tuner helps you keep your guitar sounding right. Since new strings and changes in temperature can throw off 
                            your tuning, this little tool is essential for every practice session.</ul>
                    <li>Pick</li>
                        <ul>A guitar pick makes strumming and picking much easier, especially for beginners. They're cheap and come in 
                            different sizes and thicknesses, so try a few to find what feels best.</ul>
                    <li>Capo</li>
                        <ul>A capo is a clamp that changes the key of your guitar without moving your fingers. It's super useful for playing 
                            along with songs or simplifying chords.  There are many songs that will require one of these if you want to have 
                            the same tone.</ul>
                    <li>Strap</li>
                        <ul>If you're planning to play while standing or just want extra support while sitting, a strap is a must. Make sure 
                            it's adjustable and comfortable on your shoulder.</ul>
                    <li>Guitar Bag</li>
                        <ul>A guitar bag protects your guitar from dust, scratches, and bumps, whether you're heading to lessons or just storing 
                            it safely at home. Some even have pockets for your picks and tuner.</ul>
                </ol>

                <p>Next, take a moment to get familiar with the parts of your guitar. Learning the names of each part will help you follow along 
                    with lessons and take care of your instrument. Use the diagram below to better understand your guitar</p>
                <img src="../Images/Guitar-Parts.png" alt="Guitar Parts Diagram" width="1000">
                
                <p>Lastly, learn how to hold the guitar properly—sitting or standing—so that you're comfortable and set up for success. Once you've 
                    got your gear and you're comfortable holding your guitar, you're ready to learn your first chord. Let's do this!</p>
